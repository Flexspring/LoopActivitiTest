# LoopActivitiTest

This project has 2 different processes that can be run with JUnit

   LoopProcess
   LoopInternal

## LoopProcess

This process is not able to perform more than 40 something loops with a very trivial groovy task. This is a simple version of an 
business process we have that perform action is the similar chain of actions.

## LoopInternal

Standard process to show that Activiti is able to perform the iteration when using the Multi instance tab
